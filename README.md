# About Project Noise Meter

Are you curious about the health impact of the environmental noise in Toronto?
Are you interested in measuring the environmental noise in Toronto?

Project Noise Meter is building low cost IoT devices to measure in real-time the ambient environmental noise in our neigbourhoods. A data store and a monitoring dashboard are being developed to collect and visualize the noise data. The project is under active development by a group of Civic Tech Toronto volunteers.
